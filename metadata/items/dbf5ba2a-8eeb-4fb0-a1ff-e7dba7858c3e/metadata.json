The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the Earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. \r\n\r\nThis looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space and requires a much-larger share of humanity to take part in the process. \r\n\r\nElma Yorks experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalitions attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator. But with so many skilled and experienced women pilots and scientists involved with the program, it doesnt take long before Elma begins to wonder why they cant go into space, too. \r\n\r\nElmas drive to become the first lady astronaut is so strong that even the most dearly held conventions of society may not stand a chance against her.\r\n\r\n©2018 Mary Robinette Kowal (P)2018 Audible, Inc.",
