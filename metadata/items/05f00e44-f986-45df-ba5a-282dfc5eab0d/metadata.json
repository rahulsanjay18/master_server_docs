  "description": "<p>From New York Times bestselling author Mira Grant comes a high-concept near-future thriller.<p>A decade in the future, humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease. We owe our good health to a humble parasite&#8212;a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the Intestinal Bodyguard worm protects its host from illness, boosts the immune system&#8212;and even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost all human beings have a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.<p>But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives&#8212;and will do anything to get them.",
