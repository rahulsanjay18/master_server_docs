After eleven unsuccessful expeditions to survey the area&#8212;most of which ended in the death of every team member&#8212;the twelfth expedition is ready to go. The group is made up of an anthropologist, a surveyor, a psychologist, and a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, collect specimens, record all their observations, and, above all, avoid being contaminated. They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers&#8212;they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms beyond understanding&#8212;but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.",
