In a village in ancient Norway lives a boy \nnamed Odd, and he's had some very bad luck: His father perished in a \nViking expedition; a tree fell on and shattered his leg; the endless \nfreezing winter is making villagers dangerously grumpy.\n\nOut in the forest Odd encounters a bear, a fox, and an eagleï¿½three creatures \nwith a strange story to tell. Now Odd is forced on a journey to save \nAsgard, city of the gods, from the Frost Giants who have invaded it. \nIt's going to take a very special kind of twelve-year-old boy to outwit \nthe Frost Giants, restore peace to the city of gods, and end the long \nwinter. Someone cheerful and infuriating and clever. . . .\n\nSomeone just like Odd. . . .\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNeil Gaiman is the author of many highly acclaimed and award-winning \nbooks for children and adults, including the New York Times bestseller \nCoraline. He is also the author of the picture books The Wolves in the \nWalls and The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish, both illustrated \nby Dave McKean, Blueberry Girl, illustrated by Charles Vess, and The \nDangerous Alphabet, illustrated by Gris Grimly. Among his many awards \nare the World Fantasy Award, the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the \nBram Stoker Award. Originally from England, Gaiman now lives in the \nUnited States.",
