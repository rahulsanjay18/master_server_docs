This original story by \nBaoshu-published with Liu's support-envisions the aftermath of \nthe conflict between humanity and the extraterrestrial \nTrisolarans. In the midst of an interstellar war, Yun Tianming \nfound himself on the front lines. Riddled with cancer, he chose \nto end his life, only to find himself flash frozen and launched \ninto space where the Trisolaran First Fleet awaited. Captured and\n tortured beyond endurance for decades, Yun eventually succumbed \nto helping the aliens subjugate humanity in order to save Earth \nfrom complete destruction. Granted a healthy clone body by the \nTrisolarans, Yun has spent his very long life in exile as a \ntraitor to the human race. Nearing the end of his existence at \nlast, he suddenly receives another reprieve-and another \nregeneration. A consciousness calling itself The Spirit has \nrecruited him to wage battle against an entity that threatens the\n existence of the entire universe. But Yun refuses to be a pawn \nagain and makes his own plans to save humanity's future...",
