  "description": "Raised in a family of circus performers, Helena's always dreamed of leading a more ordinary life. But when haunting music draws her into a strange and magical realm, one where anything can happen, her real life is stolen by a runaway from the other side. Helena must rescue the realm from chaos in order to win back her own not-so-ordinary life. MirrorMask is a breathtaking film written by best-selling author Neil Gaiman and brought to life through the vision of acclaimed artist and director Dave McKean. This original audio novella is Helena's tale in her own voice, a stunning and magical journey.",
