  "description": "<p>The thrilling sequel to <i>End?r\u0019s Game</i> and winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awar?s\u0014this full cast unabridged recording includes an original postscript written and recorded by the author.\r\n<p>Three thousand years have passed since Ender Wiggin won humanitys war with the Buggers by totally destroying them. Ender remains young, traveling the stars at the speed of relativity, but a hundred years or more might pass on Earth while he experiences a month-long voyage. In three thousand years, Enders books The Hive Queen and The Hegemon, written under a pseudonym, have become holy writ, while the name of Ender itself has become anathema: he is the Xenocide, the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings, killed the only other sapient race humankind had found in all the galaxy.",
