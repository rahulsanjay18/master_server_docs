  "description": "New York Times Bestseller: From four masters of epic fantasy, original short novels set in the worlds of their popular series, from Discworld to Earthsea. Robert Jordan relates crucial events in the years leading up to The Wheel of Time in “New Spring.” Ursula K. Le Guin adds a sequel to her famous books of Earthsea, portraying a woman who wants to learn magic, in “Dragonfly.” Tad Williams tells a dark and enthralling story of a haunted castle in the age before Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, in “The Burning Man.” Terry Pratchett recounts an amusing incident in Discworld, of a magical contest and the witch Granny Weatherwax, in “The Sea and Little Fishes.” Following the two previous Legends volumes that featured such authors as Stephen King, George R .R. Martin, and Anne McCaffrey, Legends 3 is a treasure trove for fans of the genre that once again showcases the very finest in fantasy writing. Praise for Legends “An enjoyable sampler of the best high fantasy available today.” —San Francisco Chronicle “A stellar compilation . . . all the selections are first-rate.” —Booklist “Superb.” —Dallas Morning News",
