  "description": "With this volume Dr. Thompson and Mrs. Harris conclude the story of U.S. Army Signal Corps operations in World War II. The Outcome is largely a success story, as it picks up in 1943 and carries on past V-J Day. Of all the technical services, the Signal Corps was least prepared for war in 1941. But by mid-war the Corps was operating efficiently at home and all over the world. Even so, there were always difficulties to be overcome. Further, other agencies conducted feuds and raids. The Army Air Forces, though using Signal Corps equipment through the end of the war, was never satisfied with it. The authors have told the story with candor. The point of view is that of the Signal Corps, but the range of subject matter should prove interesting and instructive to military men and to students of both technology and public administration.",
