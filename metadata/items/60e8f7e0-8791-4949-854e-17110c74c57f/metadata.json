  "description": "The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles of modern times, a dangerous tinderbox always poised to set the Middle East aflame--and to draw the United States into the fire. In this accessible and stimulating Very Short Introduction, Martin Bunton provides a clear and fair exploration of the political conflict between the two nations, looking at the historical basis of the struggle, how and why partition has been so difficult, and how efforts to restore peace continue today.",
