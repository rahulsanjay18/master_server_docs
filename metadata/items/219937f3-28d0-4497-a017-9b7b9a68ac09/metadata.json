Jane, the youngest of the Catwings, thinks that life on the farm is absolutely boring. Looking for adventure, she takes to the skies to explore all the world has to offer. But when she flies through the window of a friendly-seeming human, Jane finds herself captured—and forced to make TV appearances as Miss Mystery, the fabulous winged cat. How can she possibly explore the world now? Is there anywhere Jane can be truly free?",
