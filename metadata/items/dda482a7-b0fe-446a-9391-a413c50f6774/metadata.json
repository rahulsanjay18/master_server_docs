  "description": "This book of interviews aims to raise awareness and hope for a cure for Parkinson’s Disease. I contacted individuals worldwide to obtain the interviews because PD does not discriminate and affects individuals, families, and communities worldwide. I believe we must be family in this fight for a cure. When I learned that approximately 1 million individuals are diagnosed in the United States and over 10 million worldwide, I felt that many other journeys needed to be shared. So many inspired me to keep advocating for a cure!",
