  "description": "From #1 bestselling author of A Game of Thrones, Nightflyers, now a television show on SyFy and Netflix, features an epic story of space exploration and cosmic horror, plus five George R. R. Martin classic science fiction tales. On a voyage toward the boundaries of the known universe, nine misfit academics seek out first contact with a shadowy alien race. But another enigma is the Nightflyer itself, a cybernetic wonder with an elusive captain no one has ever seen in the flesh. Soon, however, the crew discovers that their greatest mystery – and most dangerous threat – is an unexpected force wielding a thirst for blood and terror.... Also included are five additional classic George R. R. Martin tales of science fiction that explore the breadth of technology and the dark corners of the human mind. “Long live George Martin....A literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.”—The New York Times At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
